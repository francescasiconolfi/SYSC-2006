### Imperative Programming 
Computation specified using statements that change the program's *state*.

The state is maintained using variables.\
Assignment statements change the program's state.\
Statements are executed sequentially.

Some Terms:
- *Loop*: Executes a sequence of statements multiple times
- *Conditional Branch*: A sequence of statements are executed only if the condition is True
- *Unconditional Branching*: jumps and subprograms/functions/procedures

Python vs. C:

In Python:

``` Python

print("Hello, world!")

```

In C:

``` C

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  
  return 0;

}

```

Example: Farenheit vs. Celsius

In Python:

``` Python

lower = 0
upper = 300
step = 20

fahr = lower
while fahr <= upper:
  celsius = 5 / 9 * (fahr - 32)
  print(fahr, round(celsius, 1))
  fahr = fahr + step
  
```

In C:

``` C

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void):
{
  int lower, upper, step;
  float fahr, celsius;
  
  // Set lower and upper limits of table and step size
  lower = 0;
  upper = 300;
  step = 20;
  fahr = lower;
  
  while (fahr <= upper)
  {
    celsius = 5.0/9.0 * (fahr - 32.0);
    printf("%4.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
    fahr = fahr + step;
  }
 
 return 0
 
 }
 
 ```

Analyzing Step-By-Step:

1. `#include <stdio.h>` is a *header file* read by the C compiler which contains information about the std I/O library (i.e. printf() fxn).

2. Each program contains at least one fxn, and execution always begins with main()
- The function header is int main(void), where int declares the fxn is returning an integer, and void declares the fxn has no argument list
- Statements in the function body are always enclosed in braces ({}) and indented (though indentation is not required by the compiler)
- Statements are terminated by semicolons (;)

3. Comments are enclosed by //* and /*/ if they span multiple lines and // if they span one
