### Imperative Programming 
Computation specified using statements that change the program's *state*.

The state is maintained using variables.\
Assignment statements change the program's state.\
Statements are executed sequentially.

Some Terms:
- *Loop*: Executes a sequence of statements multiple times
- *Conditional Branch*: A sequence of statements are executed only if the condition is True
- *Unconditional Branching*: jumps and subprograms/functions/procedures

Example:

In Python:

``` Python

print("Hello, world!")

```

In C:

``` C

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}

```
