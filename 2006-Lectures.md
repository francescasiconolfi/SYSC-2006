## Lecture 2

### Imperative Programming
Computation specified using statements that change the program's *state*.

The state is maintained using variables.\
Assignment statements change the program's state.\
Statements are executed sequentially.

Some Terms:
- *Loop*: Executes a sequence of statements multiple times
- *Conditional Branch*: A sequence of statements are executed only if the condition is True
- *Unconditional Branching*: jumps and subprograms/functions/procedures

Python vs. C:

In Python:

``` Python

print("Hello, world!")

```

In C:

``` C

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  
  return 0;

}

```

Example: Farenheit vs. Celsius

In Python:

``` Python

lower = 0
upper = 300
step = 20

fahr = lower
while fahr <= upper:
  celsius = 5 / 9 * (fahr - 32)
  print(fahr, round(celsius, 1))
  fahr = fahr + step
  
```

In C:

``` C

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void):
{
  int lower, upper, step;
  float fahr, celsius;
  
  // Set lower and upper limits of table and step size
  lower = 0;
  upper = 300;
  step = 20;
  fahr = lower;
  
  while (fahr <= upper)
  {
    celsius = 5.0/9.0 * (fahr - 32.0);
    printf("%4.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
    fahr = fahr + step;
  }
 
 return 0
 
 }
 
 ```

Analyzing Step-By-Step:

1. `#include <stdio.h>` is a *header file* read by the C compiler which contains information about the std I/O library (i.e. printf() fxn).

2. Each program contains at least one fxn, and execution always begins with main().
- The function header is int main(void), where int declares the fxn is returning an integer, and void declares the fxn has no argument list
- Statements in the function body are always enclosed in braces ({}) and indented (though indentation is not required by the compiler)
- Statements are terminated by semicolons (;)

3. A one line comment begins with //; a multi-line comment beings with /* and ends with */.

4. Variables must be declared before use by specifying the type of the variable before the name(s).

5. Assignment statements have the form: `variable = value`.

6. Iteration *while* loop has general format:

``` C

int main()
{
  while (condition)
  {
    body;
  }

}
```

where braces are only required for bodies spanning multiple lines.

Note: The body is only iterated over again if condition is True.

7. `printf("%4.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);` specifies format of each variable interpretation like so:
- % specifies formatting is following
- 4 in '%4.0f' specifies the value will be at least 4 characters wide
- 0 in '%4.0f' specifies the value will have no decimal point and no fractional digits
- 1 in '%6.1f' specifies the value (celsius) will have 1 digit after its decimal point
- The first value declared by % corresponds to the first variable listed after the str, and so on

### Elements of C

Fundamental Types:
- *char* (character - usually a byte)
- *int* (signed integer)
- *float* (single-precision floating-point)
- *double* (double-precision floating-point)
- *_Bool* (Boolean - added in C99)
- *_Complex* (Complex numbers - added in C99)

Note: There is no str type.

Type Qualifiers:
- unsigned
- short
- long

Examples:
1. 1234 is an int
2. 1.2, -7.2, 2e-3. 7.3e+4 are doubles
3. 'x' is a char
4. "x" and "hello" are str literals

Rules for Naming Variables:
- First character must be a letter (underscore included) (convention: lowercase)
- Remaining characters can be letters and digits 

Rules for Using Variables:
- Must declare a variable before use (ex. `int lower; upper;`)
- Can initialize variables whilst declaring them (ex. `int k = 0`)

Arithmetic Operators:
- Binary Operators (*, /, % have precedence over +, -)
- Integer Operators (when operands are all *int* - always rounds towards 0, as of C99) (% is only used with integers)

Relational Operators:
- \>, >=, <, <= have precedence over ==, !=

Note: Arithmetic operators > Relational operators

Operands are converted to a common type before evaluation ("narrower" operands are usually converted to "wider" operands).
- Any statements with *double*s will cause all operands to convert to *double*
- Any statements with *float*s will cause all operands to convert to *float*
- Otherwise, *char* will be converted to *int*

### If Statements
General format:

``` C

int main()
{

  if (expression)
  {
    statement 1;
    statment 2;
  }
  
return 0

}

```

Note: Statments are executed if *expression* is True.

### If-Else Statements
General format:

``` C

int main()
{

  if (expression)
  {
    statement 1;
    statment 2;
  }
  else 
  {
    statement 3;
    statement 4;
  }
  
return 0

}

```

Notes: (1) `else` is executed if *expression* is False, (2) There is no elif keyword, so only have nested if statements (else if statements), (3) There is only ever maximum one 'if' and 'else', but can have any number of 'else if' statements.

### For Loops
General format:

``` C

int main()
{

  for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
  {
    statements;
  }
  
  // Furthermore:
  
  for (initial statement; condition; incrementation)
  {
    statements;
  }
  
  // Is equivalent to:
  
  expr1;
  while (expr2)
  {
    statements;
    expr3;
  }

}

```

Example:

``` C

int main()
{
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1)
  {
    
    printf("i is %d.\n", i)
    
}
  
```

### Do-While Loop
General format:

``` C

int main()
{
  do
  {
  
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  
  }
  while (expression);

}
  
```

Note: The loop body is executed at least once, until *expression* in *while* loop is evaluated. If *expression* is True, the loop body is executed once more, and then *expression* is re-evaluted, and so on.

### Functions
Functions must be declared before use:
- Define the function ahead of all functions and then call it
- Put a function prototype ahead of all functions that call the function

Function Prototypes:\
General format: `type fxn(type parameter1, type parameter2...);`

Example:

``` C

#include <stdio.h>

int power(int m, int n); // Function prototype appears before calling, so no error

int main(void):
{
  
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 10)
  {
    printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2, i), power(-3, i));
    i = i + 1;
  }

  return 0;
 
}

int power(int base, int n)
{

  int p = 1;
  while (n > 0)
  {
  
    p *= base;
    n--;
  
  }
  
  return p;

}
 
```
 
**Arguments**:\
All function arguments are passed by value.\
Altering a parameter does not modify the corresponding argument.

### Example
zyBooks Challenge 4.7.1:

METHOD 1:

``` C

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int userNum;
  int i;
  int j;
  
  userNum = 10;
  
  // print values from 0 - userNum, one per line with spaces, equal to the number being printed
  
  for (i = 0; i <= userNUm; i++)
  {
    for (j = 0; j < i; j++)
    {
      printf(" ");
    }
    printf("%d\n", i);
  }

}
 
```

METHOD 2:

``` C

#include <stdio.h>

void printNspaces(int n)
{
  int i;
  for  (i = 0; i < n; i ++)
    {
      printf(" ");
    }
}

int main()
{
  int userNum;
  int i;
  int j;
  
  userNum = 10;
  
  // print values from 0 - userNum, one per line with spaces, equal to the number being printed
  
  for (i = 0; i <= userNUm; i++)
  {
    printNspaces(i);
    printf("%d\n", i);
  }

}

```

METHOD 3:

``` C

#include <stdio.h>

void printNspaces(int n)
{
  int i;
  for  (i = 0; i < n; i ++)
    {
      printf(" ");
    }
}

int numDigits(int n)
{
  int count;
  for (count = 0; n! = 0; count ++)
  {
    n = n / 10;
  }
  return count;
}

int main()
{
  int userNum;
  int i;
  int j;
  
  userNum = 10;
  
  // print values from 0 - userNum, one per line with spaces, equal to the number being printed
  
  for (i = 0; i <= userNum; i++)
  {
    
    printf("%*d\n", i + numDigits(i), i); // '*' is replaced by first value argument (i + numDigits(i)) and d is replaced by second (i)
  }

}

```

Note: Incrementing by 1 can be represented by double addition signs (i.e. `i++` is equivalent to `i = i + 1`, and decrementing by 1 can be represented by double subtraction signs (i.e. `i--` is equivalent to `i = i - 1`).

---

## Lecture 4

### Do-While Statement
General format:

``` C

int main()
{
  do {
    Y;
 } while (condition);
 
\\ is equivalent to:

  Y;
  while (condition) {
    Y;
  }
  
```

### For Loop
General format:

``` C

int main()
{
  for (initialization; condition; incrementation) {
    body;
  }
  
}

```

### Arrays
Declaration format: `type name[capacity]`
where # elements in array == *capacity* and each element is of the same specified *type*

**Indicies:**
- To access inidividual elements, use indexing (specify index in brackets), where indicies ranges from 0 to (*capacity* - 1) (i.e. array[1] points to the array's second element).
- An index that is negative or (>= *capacity*) will access memory outside of the array (do not want this).
- Indicies can also be expressions or function calls

Array processing loops:
``` C

int main()
{
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    \\ do something with array
  }

}
```

If using array in a function:
- First parameter: `type name[]` where *capacity* is not specified
- Second parameter: `int n` where n is the # of elements the function should process

Notes: (1) When using an array as an argument (i.e. actually calling the function), only the array's name is necessary, (2) Arrays are passed by reference (i.e. functions can actually modify arrays.

Other note: sizeof() is a function that evaluates the amount of memory allocated to an array (or just one element if indexed) (int takes up 4 bytes; a pointer takes up 8).

## Lecture 5

### Array Example
``` C
int main()
  
  // const int LENGTH = 10;
  #define LENGTH 10
  int array[LENGTH];
  int i, j, temp, index;
  
  // initialize array
  for (i = 0; i < LENGTH; i++) {
    array[i] = i + 1;
  }
  
  // print array
  printf("Initial Array: ");
  for (i = 0; i < LENGTH; i++) {
    printf("%d ", array[i]);
  }
  
  printf("\n");
  
  // reverse array
  for (i = 0; i < LENGTH/2; i++) {
    index = LENGTH - i - 1;
    temp = array[i];
    array[i] = array[index];
    array[index] = temp;
    
    // print array
    printf("Intermediate Array: step %d: ", i + 1);
    for (j = 0; j < LENGTH; j++) {
      printf("%d ", array[j]); // shows array after each step
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  
  // print array
  printf("Final Array: ");
  for (i = 0; i < LENGTH; i++) {
    printf("%d ", array[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
  
  return 0;
  
```

### Finding Mean and Median of An Array Example

``` C

int main(void) {

  const int LEN = 6;
  int arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 4, 5, 2}; // creates array with exact necessary size according to amount of elements listed
  int sum = 0;
  double mean, median;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < LEN; i+= 1) { // i only exists inside for loop, since it is initialized inside
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  
  mean = sum / (LEN*1.0); // do not want int division
  
  sort(LEN, arr); // function that sorts data (not shown here)
  
  if (LEN % 2 == 0) {
    median = (arr[LEN/2] + arr[LEN/2 - 1] / 2.0;
  }
  else { // array is odd
    median = arr[LEN/2];
  }
  
  return 0;
  
}
```

### Finding Mode of An Array

``` C

int numTimes(int ar[], int n, int value) {
  int count = 0;
  for(int i= 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (ar[i] == value) {
      count += 1;
    }
  }
  
  return count;
}

int main(void)
{

  const int LEN = 6;
  int arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 5, 2};
  int x = numTimes(arr, LEN, 3);
  int mode;
  int num;
  int temp;
  
  num = numTimes(arr, LEN, arr[0]);
  mode = arr[0];
  
  for (int i = 1; i < LEN; i++) {
     temp = numTimes(arr, LEN, arr[i]);
     if (temp < num) {
      num = temp;
      mode = arr[i];
     }
  }
  
  return 0;
} 
```

### Computer Memory Notes
When a function is called by, i.e. main(), or any function, the other function is used and accessed until the computer is finished with it, and then it is removed from the stack.

**Remember** if a function calls another that is below it, must include a function prototype above: `type function(type p1, type p2);`.

---

## Lecture 6

### Recall: Declaring Arrays
Method 1. Specifying Capacity

``` C

int main()
{
  
  type array[capacity];
}

```

Method 2. Initializing List

``` C

int main()
{
  
  type array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
}

```

where capacity is calculated based on how many values are in initializer list

### Structures
One of more variables grouped together under a single name (types can differ). This allows a group of related variables to be treated as a unit.

General format:
``` C

struct tag {
  type var1;
  type var2;
}
```
where var1 and var2 are members of the structure, and *tag* is name of tag.

Note: A structure declaration doesn't allocate memory.

Given the declaration of *point*, `struct point point1 point2` declares variables point1 and point2 as instances of type "struct point".

Visualizing the structures:

| | struct point | | struct point|
| --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| point1 | x int ? | point 2 | x int ? |
| | y int ? | | y int ? |

#### Initializing members of the structure:
`struct point point3 = {val1, val2}` assigns val1 to x and val2 to y.
OR
`point4 = (struct point) {val1, val2}` where point4 was previously declared as a struct point.

#### To declare a synonym for struct point:
`typedef struct point point_t` uses typedef ("type definition") to create synonym for struct point, in order to make it more concise.

Combining structure and typedef declarations:
``` C

typedef struct tag {
  type var1;
  type var2
} synonym;

```

#### Accessing Members:
General format: `variable.member = expression`

Example:
`point3.x += 20;`

Note: This becomes a regular int.

#### Structure Assignment
Can assign one variable to another, which will copy x, y, etc. values over (i.e. point1 = point2;)

#### Structures and Functions
``` C

point_t makepoint(int x, int y) {
  point_t temp;
  
  temp.x = x;
  temp.y = y;
  return temp;
}
```

Typical call:

``` C

int main() {

  int a, b;
  point_t point1;
  
  a = 320;
  b = 200;
  
  point1 = makepoint(a, b);
  
}
```

## Lecture 7

### Structures Example

``` C

typedef struct {
  int number;
  double credits;
  double GPA;
} student_t;

void printStudent(student_t student) {
  printf("Student Name: %d; Credits: %.1lf; GPA: %.2lf\n", student.number, student.credits, student.GPA);
}

student_t addCredit(student_t student, double credits, double numGrade) {
  
  double newCredits = student.credits + credits;
  student.GPA = ((student.credits * student.GPA) + (newCredits * newGrade)) / newCredits;
  student.credits = newCredits;
  
  return student;
  
  // or: return (student_t) {student.number, newCredits, ((student.credits * student.GPA) + (newCredits * newGrade)) / newCredits};
}

int main() {
  student_t bob = {123456789, 0, 0};
  student_t mary, fred;
  mary = (student_t) {123444444, 1, 10};
  fred.number = 123123123;
  
  printStudent(bob);
  
  bob = addCredit(bob, 1, 10);
  printStudent(bob);
  
  bob = addCredit(bob, 0.5, 12);
  printStudent(bob);
  
  bob = addCredit(bob, 0.5, 6);
  printStudent(bob);
  
  return 0;
}
```
